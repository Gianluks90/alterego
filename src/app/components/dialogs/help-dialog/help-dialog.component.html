 AGENT,
 the ALTEREGO system has verified your identity.
 You are now under constant observation.

 During the mission, follow the operational
 protocols assigned by your Division.
 Collaboration with other agents is
 authorized â€” but not recommended.

 Every transmission is monitored and stored
 in the central archive. Deviation from
 procedure will trigger an automated response.

 REMEMBER:
  - Maintain communication discipline
  - Preserve system integrity
  - Survive at all costs

> Stay alert, Agent.
> The system is watching.
