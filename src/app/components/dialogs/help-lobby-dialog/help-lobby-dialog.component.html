[LOBBY SYSTEM ONLINE] ......................... [OK]
[AGENT CONNECTION VERIFIED] ................... [OK]
-------------------------------------------------------
 AGENT,
 you have entered the mission staging area.

 Here you may:
  • Communicate through the PUBLIC CHANNEL
  • Configure your operative identity
  • Await your assigned activation turn

 SETUP FIELDS (PRIVATE):
  - Company      → irrelevant to system hierarchy
  - Name/Surname → used only for agent identification
  - Role         → cosmetic, not validated by ALTEREGO
  - Archetype    → ONLY parameter acknowledged by the system

 TURN ORDER:
  - Your number determines when you will act
  - Archetype selection is sequential: lower numbers choose 
    first
  - Agents with higher numbers must wait for their turn

 ACTIONS:
  - SAVE   → locks your configuration permanently
  - LEAVE  → removes you from the mission roster
  - LAUNCH → available only to the Host once all 
             agents are READY

> Once confirmed, alterations are no longer accepted.
> Choose carefully, Agent.
